For exported settings at 16/June/2023 when all automated tests and resources and login 
as well as other functionality is working without issues, use realm-export.json file 
for exported realm and role settings. Remember to follow additional instructions
to properly import it to Keycloak. Remember to copy over the actual 
JAR files for SPI also.(keycloak-12.0.0).

For SPI .jars, check /standalone/deployments. 
sql-remote-user-storage-provider.jar (aka remote-user-storage-provider in keycloak admin console)
is used for the mooc-app realm.

-unedited-3.jar (aka provider in keycloak admin console) 
is used for the test realm.

In ./bin, run ./standalone.sh to start server.
